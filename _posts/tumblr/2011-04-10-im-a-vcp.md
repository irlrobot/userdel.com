Passed the VCP410 exam yesterday, woohoo!  If you have been working with VMware for awhile it’s not too bad.  Memorize pointless stuff like configuration maximums and port numbers, though.  There is plenty of useless stuff like that on the test that can easily make or break you.  Good amount of reading/interpreting performance related issues and determining the appropriate solutions also.  Check out Simon Long’s blog for some good study material.  Hit me up via twitter @userdel and I can pass along some other personal study notes and stuff.
