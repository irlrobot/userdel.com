download your facebook profile?  supposedly coming.*Update 10/21*
Finally have the option to download my profile.  I guess when they said slowly rolling it out they really meant it.
*Update 10/12*
Still don’t have the option to do this.  I’m starting to wondering if this was an October Fool’s Joke…
*Update 10/8*
It’s still not available for me.  Anyone actually have the option yet?
