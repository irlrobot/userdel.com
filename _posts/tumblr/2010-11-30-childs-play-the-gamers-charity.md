child''s play: the gamers charityChild’s Play is an amazing charity put together each year by the same guys over at Penny Arcade.  Basically you can choose a children’s hospital from one on the list and you’re taken to an Amazon.com wishlist for that hospital.  The wish list contains a bunch of video games, toys, movies, music, and other entertainment for sick kids.  For more information check out their about page.  I’ve been doing this for the last 3 or 4 years and it’s amazing how much it grows each year.  If you’ve got anything to spare, even just $5 (text GAMERS to 50555 to donate $5 from your cell phone), I highly recommend you check it out!
