A couple of the sales guys I worked with when I bought my Compellent last year contacted me the other day about the new company Tegile that they work for now.  These guys were great to work with and the technical guy really knew his stuff, so I was immediately interested when I heard they had left Dell/Compellent.  The Zebi platform looks very promising, especially as there is this new marketing push for NAS over SAN these days.  Maybe something to look into if you are in the market.
