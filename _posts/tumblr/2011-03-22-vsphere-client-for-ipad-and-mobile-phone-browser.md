vsphere client for ipad and mobile phone browserEver wanted to manage Virtual Center with your mobile phone or iPad?  Rejoice, for the VMWare gods have heard your prayers! Toss up a little appliance called vCenter Mobile Access and you can manage your datacenter from your phone.  Got an iPad?  There’s an app for that!  It looks pretty good too I must admit as self a proclaimed Apple-hater.
You can vMotion, get host and guest performance info, and preform a surprising number of other administrative functions.  Takes all of 5 minutes to setup; check out the YouTube videos.
