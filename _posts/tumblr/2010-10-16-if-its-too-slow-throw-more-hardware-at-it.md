if its too slow throw more hardware at it!First of all, who the hell is even using AOL anymore?  They haven’t been relevant as an ISP for at least 10 years and last I checked aol.com looked like a Yahoo clone (i.e. crappy).
Anyway, I read this article and the one thing that stuck out in my mind was that they didn’t really mention looking into a way to improve their DB before dropping a cool million on an “SSD SAN.”  It only mentioned that “…throwing more manpower at the database problems” was more expensive.  Seems to me that Mr. Pollack should cruise on over to High Scalability and start investigating ways to improve their databases as it’s only a matter of time before they run into another hardware bottleneck.  Better yet, just let AOL die already.  Nobody is really going to miss it.
