If you add a new disk hot to a Linux machine (e.g. a new virtual disk on a VM) and it doesnâ€™t show up you can use the below command as root to scan for new disks:

echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
If you get an invalid argument error try typing it in manually instead of pasting the above in.
