So I was recently tasked with figuring out what we were going to do for storage for the next 5 years where I work.  Currently we have a 5 year old EMC CLARiiON CX3-40 and honestly I can’t wait to kick this thing to the curb.  When we bought the CLARiiON it was one of the best products on the market.  Let’s just say a lot has changed in 5 years.  
We evaluated NetApp, IBM, EMC, Hitachi, and others.  Compellent simply offers the best midrange solution at an amazing price, and I absolutely cannot wait to bring them in.  If you haven’t heard of them and you are approaching that magical 5 year mark where your current hardware support/maintenance cost goes through the roof, you need to do yourself a favor and give Compellent a look.
